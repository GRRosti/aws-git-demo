# 1. Create a list that contains 10 numbers.
# I'll create a list with more than 10 elements to ensure the operations work correctly.
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 5, 15, 25]
print(f"Original list: {my_list}")

# 2. Using the following list methods, complete the tasks below:

# Add the number 11 to the end of the list.
my_list.append(11)
print(f"List after adding 11 to the end: {my_list}")

# Remove the number 5 from the list (if it exists).
# Using a conditional check to avoid a ValueError if 5 is not in the list.
if 5 in my_list:
    my_list.remove(5)
    print(f"List after removing 5: {my_list}")
else:
    print("Number 5 was not found in the list.")
    print(f"List remains: {my_list}")


# Insert the number 3 at index 2 in the list.
# Index 2 means it will be the third element (0-based indexing).
my_list.insert(2, 3)
print(f"List after inserting 3 at index 2: {my_list}")

print("-" * 30)

# 3. Once you have modified the list, perform the following actions:

# Calculate and print the sum of all the numbers in the list.
total_sum = sum(my_list)
print(f"Sum of all numbers in the modified list: {total_sum}")

# Find and print the smallest and largest number in the list.
# Using the built-in min() and max() functions.
smallest_number = min(my_list)
largest_number = max(my_list)

print(f"Smallest number in the list: {smallest_number}")
print(f"Largest number in the list: {largest_number}")

print("-" * 30)
